Russell logical framework
================================

mdl is the implementation of Russell logical framework.
This is a language for pure mathematics, build upon a metamath (www.metamath.org)
language as a high level superstructure. mdl will support fully automatic proving
facility.

In fact, mdl program is a compiler from a relativily high-level language for the 
representation of formal mathematics to the simple and robust for checking
language metamath.

The package contains folowing programs:
	- mdl      : the mdl prover and the compiler from russell language to metamath.
	- mm       : the metamath translatro to smm.
	- metamath : original metamath checker.
	- smm      : the verifier and tanslator from smm to russell (simplified metamath)

Also package contains extensive theorem basis uset-200000.mm (metamath base), 
which includes propositional logic, predicate logic, set theory, number systems 
(natural, rational, real, complex, etc.) and some more. It is a first 200 000 lines
of set.mm metamath theorem base

Building
=====================
To build russell environment the boost jam builder is required.
Run:
    1) to build optimized version:  bjam release -j 4 toolset=gcc
    2) to build the debug version:  bjam debug -j 4 toolset=gcc

Translation tests
=================
Script 'translation', runs some chains of translations and verifications. 
To run the test on a large theorem base run:
    :~$./translate uset-200000
To run the test with the valgrind-based memory leaks tests run:
    :~$./translate uset-25000 memcheck.
