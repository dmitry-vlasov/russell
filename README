Russell logical framework
================================

mdl is the implementation of Russell logical framework.
This is a language for pure mathematics, build upon a metamath (www.metamath.org)
language as a high level superstructure. mdl supports fully automatic proving
facility.

In fact, mdl program is a compiler from a relativily high-level language for the 
representation of formal mathematics to the simple and robust for checking
language metamath.

The package contains folowing programs:
	- mdl : the mdl prover and the compiler from russell language to metamath.
	- mm : the decompiler from metamath to mdl.
	- metamath : original metamath checker.
	- smm : the verifier and tanslator for the smm language (simplified metamath)

Also package contains extensive theorem basis uset-200000.mm (metamath base), 
which includes propositional logic, predicate logic, set theory, number systems 
(natural, rational, real, complex, etc.) and some more. It is a first 200 000 lines
of set.mm metamath theorem base

Installation/Building
=====================
For installation/building instructions read INSTALL.

System requirements
===================
Full translation tests demand not less then 1Gb of RAM, not less then 150 of
free space on the hard disk.

Test scripts
============
Test scripts may be run to test the system and to obtain working mdl math library
from the original metamath library. To run tests first compile mdl, mm, smm and
metamath with the command './configure; make'. Then go to the directory 'math' and 
run appropriate script.

Translation tests
=================
Script 'translation', runs a chain of translations and verification. 
To run the test on a propositional logic base run:
    :~$./translate uset-200000
To run the test with the valgrind-based memory leaks tests run:
    :~$./translate uset-25000 memcheck.

CAUTION: complete test suite, which runs on the whole metamath theorem base, will
demand a lot of RAM.
