  Propositional calculus deals with general truths about well-formed formulas
  (wffs) regardless of how they are constructed.  The simplest propositional
  truth is ` ( ph -> ph ) ` , which can be read "if something is true, then it
  is true" - rather trivial and obvious, but nonetheless it must be proved from
  the axioms (see theorem ~ id ).

  Our system of propositional calculus consists of three basic axioms and
  another axiom that defines the modus-ponens inference rule.  It is attributed
  to Jan Lukasiewicz (pronounced woo-kah-SHAY-vitch) and was popularized by
  Alonzo Church, who called it system P2.  (Thanks to Ted Ulrich for this
  information.)  These axioms are ~ ax-1 , ~ ax-2 , ~ ax-3 , and (for modus
  ponens) ~ ax-mp . Some closely followed texts include [Margaris] for the
  axioms and [WhiteheadRussell] for the theorems.

  The propositional calculus used here is the classical system widely used by
  mathematicians.  In particular, this logic system accepts the "law of the
  excluded middle" as proven in ~ exmid , which says that a logical statement
  is either true or not true.  This is an essential distinction of classical
  logic and is not a theorem of intuitionistic logic.

  All 194 axioms, definitions, and theorems for propositional calculus in
  _Principia Mathematica_ (specifically *1.2 through *5.75) are axioms or
  formally proven.  See the Bibliographic Cross-References at
  ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mmbiblio.html for a complete
  cross-reference from sources used to its formalization in the Metamath
  Proof Explorer.
