  $( Extend wff definition to include the universal quantifier ('for all').
     ` A. x ph ` is read " ` ph ` (phi) is true for all ` x ` ."  Typically, in
     its final application ` ph ` would be replaced with a wff containing a
     (free) occurrence of the variable ` x ` , for example ` x = y ` .  In a
     universe with a finite number of objects, "for all" is equivalent to a big
     conjunction (AND) with one wff for each possible case of ` x ` .  When the
     universe is infinite (as with set theory), such a propositional-calculus
     equivalent is not possible because an infinitely long formula has no
     meaning, but conceptually the idea is the same. $)

  $c F/ $.  $( The not-free symbol. $)

  $( Extend wff definition to include the not-free predicate. $)
  wnf $a wff F/ x ph $.

  $( Define the not-free predicate for wffs.  This is read " ` x ` is not free
     in ` ph ` ".  Not-free means that the value of ` x ` cannot affect the
     value of ` ph ` , e.g., any occurrence of ` x ` in ` ph ` is effectively
     bound by a "for all" or something that expands to one (such as "there
     exists").  In particular, substitution for a variable not free in a wff
     does not affect its value ( ~ sbf ).  An example of where this is used is
     ~ stdpc5 .  See ~ nf2 for an alternative definition which does not involve
     nested quantifiers on the same variable.

     Not-free is a commonly used constraint, so it is useful to have a notation
     for it.  Surprisingly, there is no common formal notation for it, so here
     we devise one.  Our definition lets us work with the not-free notion
     within the logic itself rather than as a metalogical side condition.

     To be precise, our definition really means "effectively not free," because
     it is slightly less restrictive than the usual textbook definition for
     not-free (which only considers syntactic freedom).  For example, ` x ` is
     effectively not free in the bare expression ` x = x ` (see ~ nfequid ),
     even though ` x ` would be considered free in the usual textbook
     definition, because the value of ` x ` in the expression ` x = x ` cannot
     affect the truth of the expression (and thus substitution will not change
     the result).

     This predicate only applies to wffs.  See ~ df-nfc for a not-free
     predicate for class variables.  (Contributed by Mario Carneiro,
     11-Aug-2016.) $)
  df-nf $a |- ( F/ x ph <-> A. x ( ph -> A. x ph ) ) $.
