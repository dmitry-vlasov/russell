               Aristotelian logic: Assertic syllogisms

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  Model the Aristotelian assertic syllogisms using modern notation.
  This section shows that the Aristotelian assertic syllogisms can be proven
  with our axioms of logic, and also provides generally useful theorems.

  In antiquity Aristotelian logic and Stoic logic
  (see ~ mpto1 ) were the leading logical systems.
  Aristotelian logic became the leading system in medieval Europe;
  this section models this system (including later refinements to it).
  Aristotle defined syllogisms very generally
  ("a discourse in which certain (specific) things having been supposed,
  something different from the things supposed results of necessity
  because these things are so")
  Aristotle, _Prior Analytics_ 24b18-20.
  However, in _Prior Analytics_ he limits himself to
  categorical syllogisms that consist of three categorical propositions
  with specific structures.  The syllogisms are the valid subset of
  the possible combinations of these structures.
  The medieval schools used vowels to identify the types of terms
  (a=all, e=none, i=some, and o=some are not), and named the different
  syllogisms with Latin words that had the vowels in the intended order.

  "There is a surprising amount of scholarly debate
  about how best to formalize Aristotle's syllogisms..." according to
  _Aristotle's Modal Proofs: Prior Analytics A8-22 in Predicate Logic_,
  Adriane Rini, Springer, 2011, ISBN 978-94-007-0049-9, page 28.
  For example, Lukasiewicz believes it is important to note that
  "Aristotle does not introduce singular terms or premisses into his system".
  Lukasiewicz also believes that Aristotelian syllogisms are
  predicates (having a true/false value), not inference rules:
  "The characteristic sign of an inference is the word 'therefore'...
  no syllogism is formulated by Aristotle primarily as an inference,
  but they are all implications."
  Jan Lukasiewicz, _Aristotle's Syllogistic from the Standpoint of
  Modern Formal Logic_, Second edition, Oxford, 1957, page 1-2.
  Lukasiewicz devised a specialized prefix notation for representing
  Aristotelian syllogisms instead of using standard predicate logic notation.

  We instead translate each Aristotelian syllogism into an inference rule,
  and each rule is defined using standard predicate logic notation and
  predicates.  The predicates are represented by wff variables
  that may depend on the quantified variable ` x ` .
  Our translation is essentially identical to the one
  use in Rini page 18, Table 2 "Non-Modal Syllogisms in
  Lower Predicate Calculus (LPC)", which uses
  standard predicate logic with predicates.  Rini states,
  "the crucial point is that we capture the meaning Aristotle intends,
  and the method by which we represent that meaning is less important."
  There are two differences: we make the existence criteria explicit, and
  we use ` ph ` , ` ps ` , and ` ch ` in the order they appear
  (a common Metamath convention).
  Patzig also uses standard predicate logic notation and predicates
  (though he interprets them as conditional propositions, not as
  inference rules); see
  Gunther Patzig, _Aristotle's Theory of the Syllogism_ second edition, 1963,
  English translation by Jonathan Barnes, 1968, page 38.
  Terms such as "all" and "some" are translated into predicate logic
  using the aproach devised by Frege and Russell.
  "Frege (and Russell) devised an ingenious procedure for regimenting
  binary quantifiers like "every" and "some" in terms of unary quantifiers
  like "everything" and "something": they formalized sentences of the form
  "Some A is B" and "Every A is B" as
  exists x (Ax and Bx) and all x (Ax implies Bx), respectively."
  "Quantifiers and Quantification", _Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy_,
  ~ http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quantification/ .
  See _Principia Mathematica_ page 22 and *10 for more information
  (especially *10.3 and *10.26).

  Expressions of the form "no ` ph ` is ` ps ` " are consistently translated as
  ` A. x ( ph -> -. ps ) ` .  These can also be expressed as
  ` -. E. x ( ph /\ ps ) ` , per ~ alinexa .
  We translate "all ` ph ` is ` ps ` " to ` A. x ( ph -> ps ) ` ,
  "some ` ph ` is ` ps ` " to ` E. x ( ph /\ ps ) ` , and
  "some ` ph ` is not ` ps ` " to ` E. x ( ph /\ -. ps ) ` .
  It is traditional to use the singular verb "is", not the plural
  verb "are", in the generic expressions.
  By convention the major premise is listed first.

  In traditional Aristotelian syllogisms the predicates
  have a restricted form ("x is a ..."); those predicates
  could be modeled in modern notation by constructs such as
  ` x = A ` , ` x e. A ` , or ` x C_ A ` .
  Here we use wff variables instead of specialized restricted forms.
  This generalization makes the syllogisms more useful
  in more circumstances.  In addition, these expressions make
  it clearer that the syllogisms of Aristolean logic are the
  forerunners of predicate calculus.  If we used restricted forms
  like ` x e. A ` instead, we would not only unnecessarily limit
  their use, but we would also need to use set and class axioms,
  making their relationship to predicate calculus less clear.

  There are some widespread misconceptions about the existential
  assumptions made by Aristotle (aka "existential import").
  Aristotle was not trying to develop something exactly corresponding
  to modern logic.  Aristotle devised "a companion-logic for science.
  He relegates fictions like fairy godmothers and mermaids and unicorns to
  the realms of poetry and literature. In his mind, they exist outside the
  ambit of science. This is why he leaves no room for such non-existent
  entities in his logic.  This is a thoughtful choice, not an inadvertent
  omission. Technically, Aristotelian science is a search for definitions,
  where a definition is "a phrase signifying a thing's essence."
  (Topics, I.5.102a37, Pickard-Cambridge.)...
  Because non-existent entities cannot be anything, they do not, in
  Aristotle's mind, possess an essence...  This is why he leaves
  no place for fictional entities like goat-stags (or unicorns)."
  Source: Louis F. Groarke, "Aristotle: Logic",
  section 7. (Existential Assumptions),
  _Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy_ (A Peer-Reviewed Academic Resource),
  ~ http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-log/ .
  Thus, some syllogisms have "extra" existence
  hypotheses that do not directly appear in Aristotle's original materials
  (since they were always assumed); they are added where they are needed.
  This affects ~ barbari , ~ celaront , ~ cesaro , ~ camestros , ~ felapton ,
  ~ darapti , ~ calemos , ~ fesapo , and ~ bamalip .

  These are only the _assertic_ syllogisms.
  Aristotle also defined modal syllogisms that deal with modal
  qualifiers such as "necessarily" and "possibly".
  Historically Aristotelian modal syllogisms were not as widely used.
  For more about modal syllogisms in a modern context, see Rini as well as
  _Aristotle's Modal Syllogistic_ by Marko Malink, Harvard
  University Press, November 2013.  We do not treat them further here.

  Aristotelean logic is essentially the forerunner of predicate calculus
  (as well as set theory since it discusses membership in groups),
  while Stoic logic is essentially the forerunner of propositional calculus.

       For example, given "All men are mortal" and "Socrates is a man", we can
       prove "Socrates is mortal".  If H is the set of men, M is the set of
       mortal beings, and S is Socrates, these word phrases can be represented
       as ` A. x ( x e. H -> x e. M ) ` (all men are mortal) and
       ` A. x ( x = S -> x e. H ) ` (Socrates is a man) therefore
       ` A. x ( x = S -> x e. M ) ` (Socrates is mortal).  Russell and
       Whitehead note that the "syllogism in Barbara is derived..." from
       ~ syl .  (quote after Theorem *2.06 of [WhiteheadRussell] p. 101).  Most
