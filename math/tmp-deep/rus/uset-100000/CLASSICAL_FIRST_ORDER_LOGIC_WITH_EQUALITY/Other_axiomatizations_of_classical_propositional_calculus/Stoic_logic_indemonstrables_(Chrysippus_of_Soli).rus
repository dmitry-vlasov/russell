                Stoic logic indemonstrables (Chrysippus of Soli)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  The Greek Stoics developed a system of logic.
  The Stoic Chrysippus, in particular, was often considered one of the greatest
  logicians of antiquity.
  Stoic logic is different from Aristotle's system, since it focuses
  on propositional logic,
  though later thinkers did combine the systems of the Stoics with Aristotle.
  Jan Lukasiewicz reports,
  "For anybody familiar with mathematical logic it is self-evident
  that the Stoic dialectic is the ancient form of modern propositional logic"
  ( _On the history of the logic of proposition_ by Jan Lukasiewicz (1934),
  translated in: _Selected Works_ - Edited by Ludwik Borkowski -
  Amsterdam, North-Holland, 1970 pp. 197-217,
  referenced in "History of Logic"
  ~ https://www.historyoflogic.com/logic-stoics.htm ).
  For more about Aristotle's system, see ~ barbara and related theorems.

  A key part of the Stoic logic system is a set of five "indemonstrables"
  assigned to Chrysippus of Soli by Diogenes Laertius, though in
  general it is difficult to assign specific
  ideas to specific thinkers.
  The indemonstrables are described in, for example,
  [Lopez-Astorga] p. 11 , [Sanford] p. 39, and [Hitchcock] p. 5.
  These indemonstrables are
  modus ponendo ponens (modus ponens) ~ ax-mp ,
  modus tollendo tollens (modus tollens) ~ mto ,
  modus ponendo tollens I ~ mpto1 ,
  modus ponendo tollens II ~ mpto2 , and
  modus tollendo ponens (exclusive-or version) ~ mtp-xor .
  The first is an axiom, the second is already proved; in this section
  we prove the other three.
  Since we assume or prove all of indemonstrables, the system of logic we use
  here is as at least as strong as the set of Stoic indemonstrables.
  Note that modus tollendo ponens ~ mtp-xor originally used exclusive-or,
  but over time the name modus tollendo ponens has increasingly referred
  to an inclusive-or variation, which is proved in ~ mtp-or .
  This set of indemonstrables is not the entire system of Stoic logic.

       ponendo tollens because it avoids confusion between inclusive-or and
       exclusive-or.  (Contributed by David A. Wheeler, 3-Jul-2016.) */
